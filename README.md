# Real Time Bus Tracker 

# About

## This project involved integrating APIs and live JSON data. The application collects data from a Boston bus route and displays points on the map. 

# Operating the Program
## First, download all the files present in this repository, minding that they are all in the same folder. Go to your editor, and drag the index.html file into the web browser. 

# Roadmap For Future Improvements
## I'd like to add additional functionalities to the map, including usingn images/icons as markers, and having the map represent a different area (perhaps Omaha).
