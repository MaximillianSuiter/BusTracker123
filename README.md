# BusTracker123
#Real Time Bus Tracker

Description:
This program was created to complete a project for MIT, it's goal was to track the location of a bus. Currrently the program accomplishes this task.

How to Run:
All you have to do to run the program is to first install the files, keep them in the same folder, and launch the index.html file. It will automatically open a map and every so often, move the marker that is tracking the location.

Roadmap:
I plan on eventually moving the script information to a .js file. Currently, the script does not work outside of the main index file.

License Information:
This program's components were obtained from the MIT full time programming course, under the official MIT Copyright and License./p>
